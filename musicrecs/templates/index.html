        <p>Musicrecs is a platform for sharing spotify music recommendations anonymously with friends.</p>
        <p>To get started, <a href="#new_round_form">create a new music recommendation round</a> and then share the created round link with others.</p>
        <p>The recommendation round will have three phases:</p>
        <p class="p_index_phase"><i>Submit Phase</i>: Participants submit spotify music links of their recommendations.</p>
        <p class="p_index_phase"><i>Listen Phase</i>: Participants listen to the music and consider who may have submitted what.</p>
        <p class="p_index_phase"><i>Revealed Phase</i>: It is revealed which participants recommended what.</p>
        <p>"Snoozin" will automatically send in a recommendation for every round with something he's been listening to lately.</p>

            Who is "snoozin"?</p>
        <p class="p_index_faq_a">
            "Snoozin" is the sobriquet for the collection of Spotify API powered algorithms used to add an additional music recommendation to each round.

        <p class="p_index_faq_q">
            Do I need a Spotify account to participate?</p>
        <p class="p_index_faq_a">
            No, although it definitely enhances the experience to have an account. Spotify allows people without accounts to search and share music, which is all that is necessary to participate.
